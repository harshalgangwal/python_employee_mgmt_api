## Installation & Setup
### 1️⃣ **Install Python & MySQL**
Ensure you have **Python 3.10+** and **MySQL** installed.

### 2️⃣ **Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3️⃣ **Install Required Packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(If `pip` is not recognized, check the environment setup.)

---

## Database Configuration
### 1️⃣ **Create MySQL Database**
Login to MySQL and create a database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE employee_db;
```

### 2️⃣ **Configure Database in `db_config.py`**
Edit `db_config.py` and update credentials:
```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_mysqldb import MySQL

app = Flask(__name__)

app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'your_username'
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_password'
app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'employee_db'

mysql = MySQL(app)
```

## API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint               | Description        |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------|
| POST   | `/employee`            | Add new employee  |
| GET    | `/employees`           | Get all employees |
| GET    | `/employee/<id>`       | Get employee by ID |
| PUT    | `/employee/<id>`       | Update employee   |
| DELETE | `/employee/<id>`       | Delete employee   |

## ▶️ Running the Application
```bash
python com/app/app.py
```
(Default Flask server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`)

---

## Testing the APIs
Use **Postman** or `curl` commands:

- **Add Employee:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/employee -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"John Doe", "age":30, "department":"HR"}'
```

- **Get All Employees:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/employees
```

- **Get Employee by ID:**
```bash
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/employee/1
```

- **Update Employee:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:5000/employee/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"age":32, "department":"Finance"}'
```

- **Delete Employee:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/employee/1
```

## Conclusion
You have successfully built a **Flask REST API with MySQL** for employee management. You can extend this project by adding authentication, logging, or a frontend!

Happy Coding! 🚀
